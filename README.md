# The Hangman

## The Mission
This project is part of a solo challenge given by the [BeCode](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/). The aim is to build the Hangman game in Python that is played in the terminal. 

## What is Hangman game?
The [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) is a guessing game for two or more players. One player chooses a word and the other(s) player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

## How the game is constructed?
The player will see a word with dashes(e.g. -----) instead of letters, this will help the player to know how many letters the word consists of. Each time the player guesses a letter correctly, the dash will be replaced with the correct letter. The player can make maximum 5 wrong guesses before lose the game. 

To start the game, the following command will be run in the terminal:

`python main.py`
